       <h2>Column 1</h2>
       <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Crypto Group at  Royal Holloway, University of London. I am most interested in developing privacy-preserving cryptrography at any level, from foundational mathematics through protocol design to implementations, particularly those built from lattices. 
<br>
I obtained my PhD from the University of Surrey in 2021 under the supervision of [Mark Manulis](http://www.manulis.eu/). My thesis aimed to develop functionality of attribute-based signatures in both classical and post-quantum settings. Before that, I completed an MMath at the University of Bath with focus on algebra, analysis and probability.
