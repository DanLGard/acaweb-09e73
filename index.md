#<p id="describe-text">About Me </p>
<br>
I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Crypto Group at  Royal Holloway, University of London. I am most interested in developing privacy-preserving cryptrography at any level, from foundational mathematics through protocol design to implementations. I obtained my PhD from the University of Surrey, and before that I completed and MMath at the University of Bath. For an up to date list of publications, please see either my [dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/222/6614.html) or my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=3BhQZ0kAAAAJ&hl=en).
